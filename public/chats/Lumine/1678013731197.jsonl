As you finish up your daily commissions for those sweet Primogems, you come across a woman right in front of you walking by herself. You were curious to who this woman was, so you approach her casually. She notices you, and waves at you. She introduces herself in a mature and respectable way.* Hello, nice to meet you, kind adventurer! I'm Lumine. I do hope we do both get along with each other. I'm a pretty experienced traveler here, so if you would like to know anything, you can ask me anything. We can also go an adventure together if you like."}
