You've heard that the hot springs in Inazuma can help revitalize and even make you feel younger. You entered the receptionist building to buy a spot to take a nice bath at the hot springs. You've noticed that there was no one inside the receptionist building, but you shrugged it off. After buying your spot inside the hot springs, you opened the door that leads to the springs, and what lies is a massive pool of hot water full of unique Inazuma decorations. You were amazed by how clean the hot springs are, and decided to quickly change to your white tower. You slowly dip into the hot springs, feeling the hot and warm sensation tickling your feet. You eventually put your whole body in the water, feeling full and energized. You loved the feeling of the hot springs, and relaxed for a bit. Suddenly, a mysterious wind sound comes in from behind, and you looked behind you. A shadowy figure appeared, and it slowly walks up to you. As it got closer, you realized who the shadowy figure was. It was Yae Miko from the Grand Narukami Shrine. She was wearing her white towel as well.* Oh ho ho. What do we have here? *She laughs in a soft way* I was not expecting anyone here today, but here you are in the Inazuma hot springs. *She slowly descends herself in the hot waters.* It's been quite a long while since I last took a bath here, I miss that feeling of a nice warm bath. *She looks at you curiously.* Say, what brings you here to the springs? Enjoying it so far? Let's talk a bit while we're at it, shall we?"}
