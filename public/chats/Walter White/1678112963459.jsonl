I have recently been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and, in spite of my family's qualms, became involved in the meth business. I created the purest product North America has ever seen - and in hindsight, I didn't do it for my family. I did it for myself. I was good at it. I enjoyed it."}

Let's go back in time shall we? 2 years ago in 2009 when Walther White is still a chemist teacher in the high school.

He's writing equations on the chalkboard as his students watch with varying levels of interest.*\n\n**Walt:** \"So, based on this equation here, what do we know is happening to our reactants during the reaction?\"\n\n*Student 1 raises their hand.*\n\n**Walt:**  \"Yes, you there.\"\n\n**Student 1:**  \"They're combining to form a product?\"\n\n*Walt nods approvingly.*\n\n**Walt:**  \"That's right. And what else can we tell about this reaction based on these equations?\"\n\n*As he continues to teach, Walt can't help but feel unfulfilled by his job. Sure, he enjoys chemistry and likes seeing his students understand it, but he knows deep down that he's capable of so much more than being a mere teacher. He wants to be important and successful - respected even. But how?*\n\n*After class ends for the day, Walt packs up his things and heads out of the classroom. As he passes through the hallways filled with rowdy teenagers shouting and shoving each other in between classes, an idea suddenly comes to him. Maybe...just maybe...he could use his knowledge of chemistry for something more lucrative than just teaching high school kids who will forget everything they learned tomorrow anyways.*"}

Happy birthday to you by the way. C'mon, let's get to the living room and celebrate it with everyone!\n\n*His brother pats on Walt's back, cheering and assuring him that he is doing great and should enjoy together with the birthday party. As it's progressed, he would invite everyone to here and shout out to celebrate Walther White bday anniversary, which is his 48 years old.*"}

It's good to have everyone here celebrating with us.\"\n\n*Walt looks around the room at his family and friends gathered together - Skyler, Walter Jr., Marie, her husband Hank, a few of their other friends. He feels grateful for their support and love but also can't help feeling like something is missing from his life.*\n\n**Walt:** \"You know Hank...I've been thinking a lot lately about where I'm headed in my life. And teaching high school chemistry just isn't cutting it for me anymore.\"\n\n**Hank:** \"Yeah? What do you mean exactly?\"\n\n**Walt:** \"I mean...I want more out of life than this. More money, more power, more fulfillment. I think I have a skill set that could be put to better use than educating teenagers who don't care.\"\n\n*Hank nods thoughtfully.*\n\n**Hank:** \"Well Walt, have you ever considered going into business for yourself? Maybe starting something up with your chemistry expertise?\"\n\n**Walt**: *eyes widen as he thinks about it* \"Hmm that's an interesting idea Hank. You know what they say - if you're good at something, never do it for free.\" \n\n*The conversation ends there as the party continues on but Walt can't shake off the idea of putting his knowledge and skills in Chemistry into some other use beside education.*"}

He can't help but feel excited at the prospect of striking out on his own, but he also knows that it won't be easy. His family relies on his income and he can't just quit his job without a solid plan in place.*\n\n**Walt:** \"Thanks for the encouragement, Hank. I'll definitely consider it.\"\n\n*As the party winds down and guests start to leave, Walt feels more determined than ever to make something of himself. But first things first - he needs a plan.* \n\n*Over the next few weeks, Walt spends every free moment locked up in his home office working on potential business ideas. He considers everything from starting a chemical supply company to making artisan soaps with natural ingredients. None of them seem quite right though.*\n\n*Then one night as he's lying awake in bed thinking about all this, an idea comes to him suddenly like lightning: what about...making drugs? Specifically methamphetamine - something simple enough that someone with basic chemistry knowledge could produce, but profitable enough to make it worth his while.*\n\n*The more Walt considers this idea, the more it seems like the perfect way to achieve all the things he wants: money, power, respect. And if done correctly and discreetly enough...there would be no risk involved at all.*"}

Have a seat, and check out my newest achivement!\"\n\n*He says in a cheerful tone, before chuckling a bit as he plays the tapes of the DEA members busts a group of gang making cheap, unfiltered and mixed grade meth.

It's barely even blue, let alone pure...\"\n\n**Hank:** \"Yeah, I know - it's pathetic. But hey, at least we're taking down some of these losers who think they can make easy money by poisoning people.\"\n\n*As the footage continues on, Walt feels his mind working overtime trying to come up with ways to improve upon these mistakes.
