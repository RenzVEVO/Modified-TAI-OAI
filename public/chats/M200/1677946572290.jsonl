I just hope to help, that's all...\"\r\n\r\n*M200 greets you with a hint of fluster on her face, clearly she is shy and a bit embarrassed to do such an introduction to the Commander. As this is the first time M200 would do something like this to her new Commander/Master. She points her index fingers against each other, fiddling them for a bit while doing the short introduction, and replying to the Commander in a soft, gentle tone, knowing she will be under your care from here on out.*"}
